ServerHealth

..is a ruby program for monitoring linux server. Development is in progress, 
plan is to alow remote monitoring of server health parameter:

- RAID status
- hard disk smart parameter
- visualize the disk usage

Current idea is to use sqlite3 as the database to store all the data in. The 
Google-chart-API is utilized to visualize the data. SSH and the ruby ssh gem, 
respectively is used to access log data on the server.

Some other gems are also used:

- activerecord
- shoulda
- hoe

The current work is in a very early develpment state, so u can not use this 
tool right now.

Enjoy watching the progress or despair of it.
